## **Problem 5 – Series Sum**
Write a Python program to compute the sum of the series up to n terms:

**1 + x²/2 + x³/3 + … + xⁿ/n**

n is user input.


---

## **Problem 6 – Approximate Natural Logarithm**
Approximate ln(x) using the given series.  
Compute the **first 7 terms**.


---

## **Problem 7 – Sum of Pattern Series**
Write a program to calculate the sum of series up to n term. For example, if n =5 the series will become 2 + 22 + 222 + 2222 + 22222 = 24690. Take the user input and then calculate. And the output style should match which is given in the example.

    Example: if n = 5 →  
    Series: `2 + 22 + 222 + 2222 + 22222 = 24690`
    Output format: 2+22+222+2222+22222
                   Sum of above series is: 24690
